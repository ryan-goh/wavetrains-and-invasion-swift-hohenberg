Directories (see readme files in side each directory for more detail on how to run each code)

 - /Eckhaus_Zig-zag:: Matlab codes to compute and continue stability boundaries for wavetrains. Used to create figures in Sec. 1.3 and 1.4
   
 - /sh-front_commented::  Matlab codes to compute and continue pulled pattern forming fronts in the supercritical Swift-Hohenberg equation. Used to create figures in Sec. 1.5

 - sh_abs_spec.nb - Mathematica Code for computing the absolute and essential spectrum (in both unweighted and exponentially weighted spaces)

- /sh-auto-wavetrain-existence:: auto and matlab codes for plotting the bifurcation diagrams of wavetrains. Used for figures in Sec. 1.2
